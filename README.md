# SKILLO


SKILLO is a proximity based service for connecting people who want to teach or learn a skill. It lists people near you that want to teach skills about which they are
passionate about. SKILLO facilitates messaging
between two people and also allows users to review
each other.
SKILLO is built with Ruby on Rails, GoogleMaps API,
Gravatar, TypeAhead.js, Bootstrap, and Active Record.
